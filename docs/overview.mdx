> A headless React library for crafting multi-send transactions from a Gnosis Safe

## The problem

DAO governance proposals typically include a set of transactions, which can be encoded into a single multi-send transaction for execution from the DAO's Gnosis Safe when the vote passes.
On the user interface level, this requires components for creating and displaying batches of arbitrary transactions in an easy and understandable way.

## This solution

This library offers a set of hooks and utility functions for building React components that allow users to craft transactions for execution from a Gnosis Safe:

- [useSafeBalances](#useSafeBalances) for listing a Gnosis Safe's ETH and ERC20 balances
- [useSafeCollectibles](#useSafeCollectibles) for listing a Gnosis Safe's NFT holdings
- [useContractCall](#useContractCall) for querying contract ABIs and managing input values for contract function calls
- [encodeSingle](#encodeSingle) and [encodeMulti](#encodeMulti) for encoding a set of transactions into a multi-send transaction batch

Rather than offering ready-to-use UI components, react-multisend is a toolkit of primitives enabling developers of DAO tools to build user interfaces using their own UX patterns and design system components.

## Getting started

For building your own multi-send components we recommend using our [example components](https://github.com/gnosis/react-multisend/tree/main/docs/example) as a starting point.
Copy them to your project and adjust the code according to your needs.
The example components rely on the following dependencies, make sure to add them to your project:

- `react-multisend`
- `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/modifiers`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`
- `nanoid`

You can see the [live example](/example) in the following section.

In the [Usage](/usage) section we will go into more detail on how to best use the primitives provided by the library.

Refer to the [API](/api) section as a quick reference to all library primitives.
