<a name="transactionTypes"></a>The library support defining transactions of four
different kinds:

- `TransactionType.transferFunds`: Transfer an amount of ETH or any ERC20 token
- `TransactionType.transferCollectible`: Transfer a non-fungible token (NFT)
- `TransactionType.callContract`: Call a verified contract by selecting a function and providing input values
- `TransactionType.raw`: Any other transaction can be defined by provided the raw encoded data

Each of these types comes with its own JSON structure for representing transactions.
You can find the corresponding interfaces at: [src/types.ts]
You may use the [`createTransaction`](/api/createTransaction) function as a convenient way for creating a new, empty transaction of a certain type.

The first step of encoding a list of transactions into an executable format is provided by the [`encodeSingle`](/api/encodeSingle) function.
It turns a `TransactionInput` object into a `MetaTransaction`, i.e., a representation with an ABI encoded `data` field.

The second step takes an array of `MetaTransaction` objects, and encodes it into a single `MetaTransaction` object describing the call to the `MultiSend` contract where the individual transactions are packed encoded into `data`.
This is implemented in the [`encodeMulti`](/api/encodeMulti) function.

Example:

```ts
import { isValid, encodeSingle, encodeMulti } from 'react-multisend'

if (transactionInputs.every(isValid)) {
  const multiSendTransaction = encodeMulti(transactionInputs.map(encodeSingle))
}
```

There are various options for executing a multi-send transaction encoded this way:

- from any enabled Safe/Zodiac module via `executeTransactionFromModule` (see: [Zodiac Module base contract](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/contracts/core/Module.sol#L43))
- directly by calling the Safe's `execTransaction` function, providing the required owner signatures ([learn more](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/contracts_tx_execution/))
- collecting the required signatures on-chain, by calling `approveHash` upfront ([learn more](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/contracts_tx_execution/#on-chain-approvals))
- collecting the required signatures off-chain, by proposing the transaction using the [Safe Transaction Service](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/tutorial_tx_service_initiate_sign/)
