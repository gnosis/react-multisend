## Transfer funds and collectibles

When building UI components for defining token transfer transactions it is useful to present a list of tokens held by the Gnosis Safe as the designated sender.
The library offers two hooks to make that easy.
Both hooks take the same props as an argument, defining the Gnosis Safe instance to connect to and whether to fetch the information directly or only upon request.

#### Props

|         |           |                                                                         |
| ------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| address | `string`  | The address of the Gnosis Safe                                          |
| network | `string`  | The ID of the chain on which the Gnosis Safe lives                      |
| lazy    | `boolean` | When set to `true` it won't fetch until the `fetch` callback is invoked |

### `useSafeBalances` hook

This hook provides information about the Gnosis Safe's balances of ETH and ERC20 tokens.

```ts
const [balances, { loading, error, fetch }] = useSafeBalances({
  address,
  network,
  lazy,
})
```

#### Return value

The first item in the tuple is the list of `Balance` objects, one for each ERC20 token held by the Safe and one representing the ETH balance.
The ETH balance is identified with `null` values for the `token` and `tokenAddress` fields.

Example:

```json
[
  { "tokenAddress": null, "token": null, "balance": "100000000000000000" },
  {
    "tokenAddress": "0xa7D1C04fAF998F9161fC9F800a99A809b84cfc9D",
    "token": {
      "name": "OWL Token",
      "symbol": "OWL",
      "decimals": 18,
      "logoUri": "https://gnosis-safe-token-logos.s3.amazonaws.com/0xa7D1C04fAF998F9161fC9F800a99A809b84cfc9D.png"
    },
    "balance": "100000000000000000000"
  },
  {
    "tokenAddress": "0xc778417E063141139Fce010982780140Aa0cD5Ab",
    "token": {
      "name": "Wrapped Ether",
      "symbol": "WETH",
      "decimals": 18,
      "logoUri": "https://gnosis-safe-token-logos.s3.amazonaws.com/0xc778417E063141139Fce010982780140Aa0cD5Ab.png"
    },
    "balance": "1000000000000000000"
  }
]
```

The second item in the return tuple is an object that provides the request state for fetching the balances:

|         |                   |                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| loading | `boolean`         | Indicates whether the request is currently running               |
| error   | `Error` or `null` | If the request failed, this field will provide error information |
| fetch   | `function`        | Callback for triggering the request                              |

### `useSafeCollectibles` hook

This hook provides information about NFTs (ERC-721 token) held in the Gnosis Safe.

```ts
const [collectibles, { loading, error, fetch }] = useSafeCollectibles({
  address,
  network,
  lazy,
})
```

#### Return value

The first item in the tuple is the list of `Collectible` objects, one for each NFT held by the Safe. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "address": "0x16542D57057Ee50C6FA7d95b44b7eC5a1ab0B410",
    "tokenName": "Ben's NFT Store",
    "tokenSymbol": "ETH",
    "logoUri": "https://gnosis-safe-token-logos.s3.amazonaws.com/0x16542D57057Ee50C6FA7d95b44b7eC5a1ab0B410.png",
    "id": "12",
    "uri": "https://arweave.net/1LPEBm4iiG5PhUcNqnee2WeLn-fPq9mbT6sfBZAOSGQ",
    "name": "Sam",
    "description": "Tokenized Image of Sam A",
    "imageUri": "https://arweave.net/xRCOWRmpjlVzqboTN-VV6RYqad1PtyZwjv6tUrq2mn0",
    "metadata": {
      "minter": "0x7f01d9b227593e033bf8d6fc86e634d27aa85568",
      "mintedOn": "2021-09-30T07:36:55.021Z",
      "name": "Sam",
      "description": "Tokenized Image",
      "category": "DuNvaKK8KICzyMuTex2F",
      "type": "ERC721"
    }
  }
]
```

The second item in the return tuple is an object that provides the request state for fetching the list of collectibles:

|         |                   |                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| loading | `boolean`         | Indicates whether the request is currently running               |
| error   | `Error` or `null` | If the request failed, this field will provide error information |
| fetch   | `function`        | Callback for triggering the request                              |

## Arbitrary contract calls

The package offers an additional hooks for making contract function calls leveraging the contract's interface.

### `useContractCall` hook

This hook fetches smart contract interface information from Etherscan or the respective block explorers of other chains.

```ts
const { functions, inputs, payable, loading } = useContractCall({
  value,
  onChange,
  network,
  blockExplorerApiKey,
})
```

It reads and updates a `CallContractTransactionInput` value, which has the following fields:

```ts
{
  to: string // contract address
  value: string // amount of wei to send
  abi: string // contract interface ABI as JSON string
  functionSignature: string // function to call
  inputValues: { [key: string]: ValueType } // values to pass as input parameters with the function call
}
```

## Encode for execution

<a name="transactionType"></a>
The library supports defining transactions of four different kinds:

|                                       |                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TransactionType.transferFunds`       | Transfer an amount of ETH or any ERC20 token                                |
| `TransactionType.transferCollectible` | Transfer a non-fungible token (NFT)                                         |
| `TransactionType.callContract`        | Call a verified contract by selecting a function and providing input values |
| `TransactionType.raw`                 | Any other transaction can be defined by provided the raw encoded data       |

Each of these types comes with its own JSON structure for storing transaction inputs.
You can find the corresponding interfaces at: [src/types.ts](https://github.com/gnosis/react-multisend/blob/main/src/types.ts)

The `TransactionInput` JSON structure is not directly useful for execution but needs to be mapped to the `MetaTransaction` type used by Gnosis Safe to represent transactions.
The library offers two functions, `encodeSingle` and `encodeMulti`, that are combined to achieve this.

```ts
encodeSingle(transactionInput: TransactionInput): MetaTransaction
```

The first step of encoding a list of transaction inputs into an executable format is provided by the `encodeSingle` function.
It turns a `TransactionInput` object into a `MetaTransaction`, i.e., a representation with an ABI encoded `data` field.

```ts
encodeMulti(metaTransaction: MetaTransaction): MetaTransaction
```

The second step takes an array of `MetaTransaction` objects, and encodes it into a single `MetaTransaction` object describing the call to the `MultiSend` contract where the individual transactions are packed encoded into `data`.
This is implemented in the [`encodeMulti`](/api/encodeMulti) function.

### Example

```ts
import { isValid, encodeSingle, encodeMulti } from 'react-multisend'

if (transactionInputs.every(isValid)) {
  const multiSendTransaction = encodeMulti(transactionInputs.map(encodeSingle))
}
```

There are various options for executing a multi-send transaction encoded this way:

- from any enabled Safe/Zodiac module via `executeTransactionFromModule` (see: [Zodiac Module base contract](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac/blob/master/contracts/core/Module.sol#L43))
- directly by calling the Safe's `execTransaction` function, providing the required owner signatures ([learn more](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/contracts_tx_execution/))
- collecting the required signatures on-chain, by calling `approveHash` upfront ([learn more](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/contracts_tx_execution/#on-chain-approvals))
- collecting the required signatures off-chain, by proposing the transaction using the [Safe Transaction Service](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/tutorial_tx_service_initiate_sign/)
